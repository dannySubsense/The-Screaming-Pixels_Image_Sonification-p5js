SCI 6483 class assignment - Image manipulation project

The Screaming Pixels is an exploration of image sonification using p5js.  
Begin by launching index.html locally and select one of the four options: Mouse The Music, Frame The Music, Maze The Music, and Imagine the Music.

A new page will open for each option. 

Mouse The Music:
  sketch_v1_mouseHover.js
This code sets up a canvas and allows users to manipulate sliders to generate an image with changing colors and patterns, while also producing musical tones based on the color values of the mouse cursor within the image.
